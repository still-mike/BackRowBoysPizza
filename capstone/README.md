# Tech Elevator Final Capstone - Back Row Boys Pizza

My final capstone project at Tech Elevator, built in a four-person team over the course of 10 working days. We utilized Agile methodologies, starting from scratch to build out an online ordering site for a fictional local pizza shop. The site functions as both as a place for users to place orders, as well as for employees to manage those orders.
